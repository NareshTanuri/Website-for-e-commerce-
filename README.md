An online storefront 
In an e-commerce website, all product object data is stored in products and used in createContext. Call createContext outside of any components to create a context. In phosphor-react, we can add some icons, so when I use this package, npm i phosphor-react bootstrap. In this package, when I am some css styles, can apply npm i bootstrap@5.0.1.
Additionally, NavBar, search filter carts, and continuous store are all floder. After I integrate these features in the login page and sideNav, I plan to add some more.

npm i bootstrap@5.0.1
npm i phosphor-react
